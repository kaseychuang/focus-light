# What is FocusLight?
It is a simple web-based to do list and timer to keep you on track with your goals. Add tasks to your list. Set the timer to start working! Check off the task when you have completed it. 

### Inspiration
With so much time and so much to do, it can be easy to get overwhelmed. This summer I've been juggling a lot tasks, such as working on projects, chores, coursework. I also tend to get off track while multi-tasking, making it hard to actually get tasks completed. I wanted to create a minimalistic website to help me focus on one task at a time throughout the day. (I wanted a platform NOT on an app due to the distracting nature of phones) I also wanted to gain more practice working with the React.js framework, to solidify my understanding of hooks and state.

## What's Next?
The current version of of FocusLight is very basic, but I hope to add new features in the future:
  - "Focus Mode" with a full-screen timer
  - Dark/Light mode for those working at different times of the day
  - Database task storage, accessible via username
